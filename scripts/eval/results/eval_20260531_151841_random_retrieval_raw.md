## craft/iron_horse_armor (L3) — goal: iron_horse_armor
Parse: OK | Strict: PASS | Lenient: PASS
======================================================================

**REASONING**:
I referenced the examples provided, particularly Example 3: Craft an Iron Axe, to understand the pattern for crafting items that require smelting and additional components. The target item is "iron_horse_armor", which requires iron ingots. The material type is "iron", and the tool type is "horse armor". Horse armor does not follow the standard tool quantity pattern but requires 6 iron ingots.

**EXECUTION PLAN**:
Step 1: Collect logs and craft basic tools
Prerequisites: None
Command: !collectBlocks("oak_log", 4)
Command: !craftRecipe("oak_planks", 12)
Command: !craftRecipe("stick", 4)
Command: !craftRecipe("wooden_pickaxe", 1)
Reasoning: We need a wooden pickaxe to mine stone and then craft a stone pickaxe, which is required to mine iron ore.

Step 2: Mine cobblestone and craft stone pickaxe
Prerequisites: item:wooden_pickaxe:1, access:stone
Command: !collectBlocks("stone", 3)
Command: !craftRecipe("stone_pickaxe", 1)
Reasoning: A stone pickaxe is needed to mine iron ore, which is required to craft iron horse armor.

Step 3: Mine iron ore
Prerequisites: item:stone_pickaxe:1, access:underground
Command: !collectBlocks("iron_ore", 6)
Reasoning: We need 6 iron ore to smelt into iron ingots for the iron horse armor.

Step 4: Smelt raw iron into iron ingots
Prerequisites: item:raw_iron:6, station:furnace
Command: !smeltItem("raw_iron", 6)
Reasoning: Iron ore must be smelted into iron ingots before it can be used to craft the iron horse armor.

Step 5: Craft an Iron Horse Armor
Prerequisites: item:iron_ingot:6, station:crafting_table
Command: !craftRecipe("iron_horse_armor", 1)
Reasoning: With 6 iron ingots, we can now craft the iron horse armor at the crafting table.
